Emil Wiman is a Ph.D. student at the Reasoning and Learning Lab (ReaL), Department of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University, Sweden. He is part of the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/), supervised by Professor [Fredrik Heintz](https://liu.se/medarbetare/frehe08) and [Mattias Tiger](https://liu.se/medarbetare/matti23). His research focuses on safe motion planning in dynamic environments, 3D exploration planning, as well as improving performance and safety for autonomous systems through learning. He is connected to [WARA-PS](https://portal.waraps.org/), which serves as a testbed for deploying his research on real robotics platforms. He has published research in top robotics conferences such as ICRA and IROS.

He joined Linköping University as a WASP Ph.D. student in August 2023 after obtaining his M.Sc. degree in Autonomous Systems, with a thesis that was awarded Best Thesis by the Swedish Artificial Intelligence Society (SAIS).

## Personal Interests

Outside of research, I'm passionate about staying active and pushing my limits through CrossFit, climbing, running, cycling, swimming, skiing, and hiking. I love exploring new places and cultures through traveling, and few things beat a great meal paired with good drinks in good company.

When I'm winding down, you'll often find me enjoying music, catching a play or art exhibition, binge-watching a great series, or diving into a video game. It's all about balance!
